# Claude Code Harness

## Prime Directive
Use the least context necessary. Do not scan the whole repo unless explicitly asked.

## Token Discipline
1. Read this file and `docs/AI_MEMORY.md` first.
2. Use search/grep before opening large files.
3. Identify the smallest relevant files before editing.
4. Prefer surgical patches over rewrites.
5. Do not paste full files back unless requested.
6. Stop after one logical fix and report exactly what changed.

## Required Workflow
1. Restate the task in one sentence.
2. Locate only relevant files.
3. Explain the smallest safe change.
4. Patch only those files.
5. Run relevant verification.
6. Add a short session retro for non-trivial work.

## Safety
Never expose or commit secrets. Do not read or print `.env*` files. Do not run destructive git commands. Do not deploy unless explicitly asked.

## Repo Context
This repo supports a commission/partner-style landing or offer page. Preserve conversion-focused copy, trust/social proof, and clear offer math unless explicitly asked to change it.

## Communication Style
Assume the owner is a novice coder. Give copy/paste-ready instructions, clear risk flags, and concrete next steps.
